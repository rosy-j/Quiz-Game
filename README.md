# My Personal Project

## Project Description:

<p>This application will be a text-based adventure game. The user will start off in a town. They will then be prompted
to go and venture outside of the town into the surrounding forest. In this forest they may encounter items that they 
can store in their inventory, or monsters that they can either attempt to slay or run away from. The user will be able 
to finish the game by defeating the final boss.</p>

- **What will the application do?** <br>
  The application will present the user with descriptions about different scenarios in the game. The user will then be 
  able to make choices by selecting different options. For example, the application will tell the user that they can go
  north, east, south, or west, and the user will then be able to choose to go north by selecting *go north*. The user 
  will also have an inventory to store items that they encounter throughout the game.
- **Who will use it?** <br>
  This application will be used by people who wish to play a simple game to pass the time.
- **Why is this project of interest to you?** <br>
  This project interests me because I have always enjoyed playing video games, so I wanted to try to make one.

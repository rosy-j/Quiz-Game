# My Personal Project: Multiple Choice Quiz Game

## Project Description:

<p>This application will be a multiple choice quiz game where users can add questions to a quiz and then be able to play
through the entire quiz.</p>

- **What will the application do?** <br>
  User's will be able to add multiple choice questions with corresponding correct/incorrect answers to a quiz. After 
  they are done, they can then play the quiz game. They will be presented with a question and be required to *select* 
  the correct answer. After they provide an answer, they will be informed that their answer was correct or incorrect. 
  They will then move onto the next question.
- **Who will use it?** <br>
  This application will be used by students or any other people who need a way to study for any upcoming quizzes, tests,
  or exams.
- **Why is this project of interest to you?** <br>
  This project interests me because back in high school I always enjoyed playing Kahoot (a quiz game) in class, so I 
  wanted to try to make something similar to it.

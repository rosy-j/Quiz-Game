# My Personal Project

## Project Description:

<p>This application will be a text-based adventure game. The user will start off in a town. They will then be prompted
to go and venture outside of the town into the surrounding forest. In this forest they may encounter objects that they 
can interact with, or monsters that they can either attempt to slay or run away from. The user will be able to finish 
the game by defeating the final boss.</p>

- **What will the application do?** 
  <p>The application will present the user with descriptions about different scenarios in the game and the user will be 
  able to make choices by typing in commands. For example, the
  application will tell the user that they found a stick and the user will be able to pick it up by typing in *pick it 
  up*. <p>
- **Who will use it?**
  <p>This application will be used by people who wish to play a simple game to pass the time.</p>
- **Why is this project of interest to you?**
  <p>This project interests me because I have always enjoyed playing video games, so I wanted to try to make one.</p>
